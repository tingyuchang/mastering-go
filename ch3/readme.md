# Composite Data types

## Maps
- we can access all elements of a map in linear time
- we should make no assumptions about the order of the elements inside a map. Go randomizes keys when iterating over a map
- if you try to store data on a nil map, your program will crash
- In real-world applications, if a function accepts a map argument, then it should check that the map is not nil before working with it.
